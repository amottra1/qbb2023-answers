Step 2: What fraction of peaks were retained when intersected compared to sample1? Sample2?

Sample1 by itself has 939/3 peaks, sample2 itself has 995/3 peaks, the combined list has 1047/3 peaks. So in comparing the sum of the samples to the combined list it appears that 1047/(939+995) of peaks were retained

Step 3: How reproducible are the peaks called between the two samples? Is the p-value range of a peak indicative of reproducibility? Is it completely consistent?

The peaks between the 2 samples are pretty reproducible. They look similar to each other. The p value range is indicative of reproducability in that more extreme p values tend to be more reproducible. They are not completely similar but they are similar to the reference genome so they are likely both wild type samples.
