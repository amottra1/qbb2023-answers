Step 1.1

How many 100bp reads are needed to sequence a 1Mbp genome to 3x coverage?

(Coverage*Total size)/(# base pairs/read)= # reads needed
(3*1Mbp)/100bp= 30,000 reads needed


Step 1.3

In your simulation, how much of the genome has not been sequenced (has 0x coverage)?

~5% of the genome has 0 coverage

How well does this match Poisson expectations? How well does the normal distribution fit the data?

Poisson matches fairly well, a bit better than the normal distribution.



Step 1.4

In your simulation, how much of the genome has not been sequenced (has 0x coverage)?

~0.003% has 0 coverage

How well does this match Poisson expectations? How well does the normal distribution fit the data?

Poisson matches very well and normal also matches pretty well, but not quite as well.



Step 1.5

In your simulation, how much of the genome has not been sequenced (has 0x coverage)?

~0.001% has 0 coverage

How well does this match Poisson expectations? How well does the normal distribution fit the data?

Poisson matches very well, still slightly better than normal. As coverage is increasing, the match gets better.
